PART ONE:

    >>> print_product(3, 5)
    15

    >>> repeat_string("Balloonicorn", 3)

    >>> print_sign(3)
    Higher than 0

    >>> print_sign(0)
    Zero

    >>> print_sign(-3)
    Lower than 0

    >>> is_divisible_by_three(12)
    True

    >>> is_divisible_by_three(10)
    False

    >>> num_spaces("Balloonicorn is awesome!")
    2

    >>> num_spaces("Balloonicorn is       awesome!")
    8

    >>> total_meal_price(30)
    34.5

    >>> total_meal_price(30, .3)
    39.0

    >>> sign_and_parity(3)
    ['Positive', 'Odd']

    >>> sign_and_parity(-2)

    'Engineer Balloonicorn'

    >>> full_title("Jane Hacks", "Hacker")
    'Hacker Jane Hacks'

    >>> write_letter("Jane Hacks", "Hacker", "Balloonicorn")

# PART ONE

# 1. Write a function called 'hello_world' that does not take any arguments and
#    prints "Hello World".


# 2. Write a function called 'say_hi' that takes a name as a string and
#    prints "Hi" followed by the name.


# 3. Write a function called 'print_product' that takes two integers and
#    multiplies them together. Print the result.


# 4. Write a function called 'repeat_string' that takes a string and an integer
#    and prints the string that many times


# 5. Write a function called 'print_sign' that takes an integer and prints
#    "Higher than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower than zero.
#    If the integer is zero, print "Zero".


# 6. Write a function called 'is_divisible_by_three' that takes an integer and
#    returns a boolean (True or False), depending on whether the number is
#    evenly divisible by 3.


# 7. Write a function called 'num_spaces' that takes a sentence as one string
#    and returns the number of spaces.


# 8. Write a function called 'total_meal_price' that can be passed a meal price
#    and a tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip percentage should
#    be optional; if not given, it should default to 15%.


# 9. Write a function called 'sign_and_parity' that takes an integer as an
#    argument and returns two pieces of information as strings --- "Positive"
#    or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two strings should be returned in
#    a list.
#
#    Then, write code that shows the calling of this function on a number and
#    unpack what is returned into two variables --- sign and parity (whether
#    it's even or odd). Print sign and parity.

# PART TWO

# 1. Write a function that takes a name and a job title as parameters, making
#    it so the job title defaults to "Engineer" if a job title is not passed
#    in. Return the person's title and name in one string.

# 2. Given a recipient name & job title and a sender name, print the following
#    letter:
#
#       Dear JOB_TITLE RECIPIENT_NAME, I think you are amazing!
#       Sincerely, SENDER_NAME.
#
#    Use the function from #1 to construct the full title for the letter's
#    greeting.

def full_title(first_and_last_name, job_title = "Engineer"):
    """ returns the job title and name as one string"""
    return job_title + ' ' + first_and_last_name

def write_letter(recipient_name, job_title, sender_name):
    """ returns the message after calling the full_title function above"""
    letter_content =  "Dear " + full_title(recipient_name, job_title) +  ", I think you are amazing! Sincerely, " + sender_name
    print letter_content
